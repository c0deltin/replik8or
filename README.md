# replik8or
A Kubernetes ConfigMap and Secrets replicator.

## Description
replik8or copies annotated ConfigMap's and Secrets into other kubernetes namespaces.
It's heavily inspired by emberstack/kubernetes-reflector! The reason for this project is that I've once faced a bug in 
the kubernetes-reflector project but I really really don't like C# 🙃.

## Usage
